#### HTML 
<img width="1495" height="582" alt="HTML Validation ParentCode" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/995f33ec-f3a3-4d24-83ec-befeaf99f84b" />

## Bugs

### 500 Server Error 
<img width="475" height="84" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-13 at 14 04 27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/560699a9-ede3-4588-81ea-44bdb22e07d8" />
 This was the major issue with my initial submission of the project as it prevented much of the site to function. This was especially true when loading the page, attempting to sign up/ login to the admin site. 

To resolve this, I contacted my facilitator at the Code Institute, who helped provide feedback on how to test iteratively. I then utilised Chrome Developer Tools and AI to identify where the source of the problem was and discovered that it had been an issue in the base HTML file, and the site was trying to authenticate before the new user was saved and using request.POST.get('field') instead of the form’s cleaned data. I made changes to views/forms and the template to fix this.  It now runs as intended. 


---

## Deployment

This website is deployed to Heroku from a GitHub repository.  
Follow these steps:

### Creating a Repository on GitHub

1. Sign in to GitHub and go to the Code Institute’s template.
2. Click **Use this template** then **Create a new repository**.
3. Enter a name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
4. Click the green **Gitpod** button to open a workspace and begin development.

### Creating an App on Heroku 

  1. After creating the repository, sign in to Heroku.
  2. Click **New** then **Create new app**.
  3. Enter a unique app name and select a region (for example, Europe).
  4. Click **Create app**.


### Create a Database

  1. Log into PostgreSQL(CIdatabase maker).
  2. Add your email address and submit the form.
  3. Open the database link sent to your email.
  4. Copy the database URL and paste it into:
     - `DATABASE_URL` variable in `env.py`
     - Heroku Config Vars


### Deploying to Heroku 

<img width="1512" height="828" alt="Deployment Screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd259ff3-4338-4fdb-a5c2-ea10a697ffbf" />

  1. Go to your app in Heroku and open the **Settings** tab.
  2. Scroll to **Config Vars** and set:
     - `DATABASE_URL` (your database URL)
     - `SECRET_KEY` (a unique secret key)
     - `CLOUDINARY_URL` (your Cloudinary URL)
     - `PORT` as `8000`
  3. Go to the **Deploy** tab and select **GitHub** as your deployment method.
  4. Connect your GitHub account and repository.
  5. Scroll to **Manual Deploy** and click **Deploy Branch**.
  6. Once deployment finishes, click **View App** to open your live site.

  **Note:** When deploying manually, redeploy after each repository update.

## Credits

**Personal Note:** 
I'd like to thank my wife and baby daughter for their patience and support for me throughout this journey. It wasn't easy, but having you both by my side has made each moment worth fighting through. 

Another thank you to the course convenors and facilitators at the Code Institute(you know who you are), for the resources and sessions and the personal help received in moments of crisis. 

I also send a huge thank you to my cohort group, where I not only made professional links but genuine friendships along the way! Thank you for pushing me again, you know who you are!

### Resources Used:

### AI 
AI was an instrumental tool that helped me to debug errors during development, planning and testing phases. I utilised a variety of LLM's to diversify the quality of the code and to ensure I was building appropriately. I have used it to generate User story ideas, which were edited to suit my specific desire and brief for the project, and find relevant content for some of the posts with reference to real-world events. 

### Code 
- Code Institute Learning Management System - Used to recap coding concepts on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Databases. 
- Code Star Walkthrough project - This was a major tool in building the entire site, as step-by-step instructions were presented, especially when tackling more of the back-end technical aspects of Django, PostgreSQL, and deployment.  
- Kaleidoscope Learning Project - Used for some of the CSS Styling  
- Dev Hawks Quiz Project - Used for some of the CSS Styling
  
### YouTube/Media Tutorials

### Images
Most images were sourced using Pexels. I added a personal image for the About Us page, and the logo was an AI-generated design with a specific prompt that required using the colour palette to facilitate consistency and a strong theme across the app.  

- **Logo**: AI-generated design.
