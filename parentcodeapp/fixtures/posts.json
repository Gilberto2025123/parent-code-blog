Yet the momentum of the tech world demands continuous learning. Thankfully, there are programmes tailored for busy adults. For example, the UK’s Skills Bootcamps offer flexible training in software development and data roles — often completing in under 16 weeks. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>\n<p>One of my former colleagues enrolled in a Skills Bootcamp while caring for a toddler; she took evening classes and progressed steadily from zero to building React components within months. The modular nature of these courses makes them ideal for parenting schedules.</p>\n<p>If you want to sample before committing, try mini-courses or microcredentials in AI, UX or data. Sites like Coursera, edX, and FutureLearn give you short bursts of learning you can fit in during naps or waiting times. Over time, these add up. Stay curious, stay consistent — and know that even a 30-minute module counts.</p>",

Instead, pick a newsletter or RSS feed and read 10 minutes daily. For example, follow **TechUK** for UK-centric tech trends and sustainability policy. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}</p>\n<p>The UK’s engineering and STEM landscape is also documented via **EngineeringUK**, offering reports and educational outreach programmes. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19} These help you see where demand is growing (e.g. climate tech, data engineering).</p>\n<p>One hack: on your weekly commute or chores, listen to a 15-minute podcast on AI or software engineering. Over months, you’ll build a strong mental map without feeling overwhelmed.</p>",

Even cron jobs for birthday emails count.</p>\n<p>For instance, build a slack bot that nudges your partner about diaper stock or a home script that turns off lights after kids’ bedtime. These little projects sharpen your skills while saving mental cycles.</p>\n<p>In the broader community, hackathons like Encode London (24–26 October) often feature “life hacks” categories. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20} You could propose your script idea, get feedback, or package it for others to use. Your daily life becomes your dev lab.</p>",
